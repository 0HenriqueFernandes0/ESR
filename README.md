Utilizing the CORE emulator as our primary testing environment and
deploying one or more test topologies, our objective is to develop a
prototype capable of delivering real-time audio/video/text content from
a central server to a dynamic set of N clients. To achieve this, we will
designate a Rendezvous Point (RP) responsible for receiving and dissemi-
nating the content to the clients . This dissemination will occur through
a network of intermediary nodes, forming a collaborative distribution
tree. It’s imperative that this tree’s construction and maintenance are
optimized to ensure efficient content delivery, minimizing both latency
and required bandwidth.
